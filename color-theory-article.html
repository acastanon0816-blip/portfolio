      <h2>Websites Compared</h2>
      <p>
        As an avid traveler, for this article, I chose to compare two travel websites. Because travel is typically a leisure activity, my comparison evaluates how color choices affect usability,
        mood, hierarchy, and accessibility.
      </p>

      <h3>Expedia</h3>

<p>
  Expedia employs a palette comprised of primarily blue and white with accents of yellow and orange.
  The cool blues give off a sense of trust and reliability, which
  is important for users when booking travel. The white background makes the layout
  clean and easy to read, while the warm accent colors draw the user's eye to calls-to-action
  like “Search” buttons or hot deals.
</p>

<h3>Travelocity</h3>

<p>
  Travelocity, like Expedia, uses blue as its dominant color. Paired with white and touches of
  warmer tones, its color hues lean slightly lighter which make images appear more vibrant.
  This creates a more energetic feel for a user. The buttons and interactive elements seem to use bold
  blue or contrasting warm tones to stand out, proividing guidance to users through the
  booking process.
</p>

<h2>Comparison and Conclusion</h2>
<p>
  Both platforms, Expedia and Travelocity, rely on blue as a trusted primary color.
  This seems to be common for travel websites because blue symbolizes loyalty and stability,
  invoking confidence in users. It also supports ease of navigation. Expedia’s palette is slightly
  more corporate in its tone, with deeper blues and restrained accent use, while
  Travelocity’s brighter blue and energetic accents make it a more playful, modern
  platform. In both sites, the contrast provides clear readability
  for key interactive elements such as search forms and buttons.
  If either site wanted to improve accessibility further, I would recommend increasing color contrast
  on some text elements to increase readability for users with visual impairments.

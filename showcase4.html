        <h2>Challenges and Improvements</h2>
        <p>
          A challenge across these projects was timing and pacing—making sure movement feels
          smooth and the viewer has enough time to read the message. These projects helped me
          practice planning animations on the timeline and keeping layers organized. Next time,
          I would experiment with more advanced easing and refine transitions for an even more
          polished result.

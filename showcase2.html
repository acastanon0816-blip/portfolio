        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The aim of this project was to create a brand package in Adobe Photoshop. The goal was to
          design a consistent visual identity and apply it across multiple marketing
          materials. The final package includes a logo, a business card design, and an
          Instagram cover graphic to demonstrate how the brand would appear across
          platforms.

        <h2>Deliverables</h2>

        <h3>1) Logo</h3>
        <p>
          I created a logo that represents the brand in a clear and audience appropriate way.
          I focused on readability, balance, and a design that works at different sizes.

        <h3>2) Business Card</h3>
        <p>
          The business card uses the same brand elements (type, colors, spacing) to keep
          the identity consistent. I included a clean layout to make contact information
          easy to read.

        <h3>3) Instagram Cover</h3>
        <p>
          This Instagram cover graphic was designed to match the brand’s look and feel
          while being visually engaging for social media. I used strong hierarchy and
          simple shapes to help the text stand out.

        <h2>Tools and Techniques Used</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Layers and layer organization:</strong> kept each element editable and easy to update or copy.</li>
          <li><strong>Shape tools and alignment:</strong> created clean layouts and consistent spacing.</li>
          <li><strong>Type Tool:</strong> to keep text readable and balanced, but also fun
          <li><strong>Transformation Tool:</strong> allowed resizing without losing quality.</li>
          <li><strong>Exporting assets:</strong> saved final files in web-friendly formats for portfolio display.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Challenges and Improvements</h2>
        <p>
          One challenge I faced was learning how to subtract shapes correctly when creating the banner.
          The option was not available because I was not using the correct tool settings. After lots of trial
          and error, at times deleting the layer and starting all over again, I finally adjusted the shape mode
          and was able to complete it properly.

        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
          In this project, I restored a vintage photograph while maintaining the natural
          look and texture of the original image. The client wanted blemishes removed
          without making the photo look “over-edited.” My goal was to improve clarity
          and reduce damage while keeping the authentic vintage quality.

        <h2>Tools and Techniques Used</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Layers:</strong> I worked non-destructively by duplicating the original and making edits on separate layers.</li>
          <li><strong>Spot Healing Brush:</strong> I removed small marks and dust quickly while blending with surrounding pixels.</li>
          <li><strong>Healing Brush:</strong> I corrected larger blemishes with more control over texture and blending.</li>
          <li><strong>Adjustment Layers:</strong> I improved tone and contrast while keeping edits editable and reversible.</li>
          <li><strong>Zoom and careful selection:</strong> I worked in close detail to avoid altering facial features or important details.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Challenges and Improvements</h2>
        <p>While overall, I feel more competent with the tools needed for this project, an area for
improvement for me is definitely regarding layers and masks. In retrospect, I wonder if it would
have been more beneficial to create a layer for each element that was being healed (hair, face,
coat, background). Repairing larger damaged areas while keeping textures consistent with the
surrounding image may have been more easily managed with more layers. Although the final
result meets the project requirements, additional time could have been spent refining subtle
texture transitions.
If I had to do this project again, I would continue to refine localized adjustments, attempt the use
of layers and masks and test more frequently between the restored and original images to be sure
the most natural result possible is achieved.

        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
          In this project, I restored a vintage photograph while maintaining the natural
          look and texture of the original image. The client wanted blemishes removed
          without making the photo look “over-edited.” My goal was to improve clarity
          and reduce damage while keeping the authentic vintage quality.

        <h2>Tools and Techniques Used</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Layers:</strong> I worked non-destructively by duplicating the original and making edits on separate layers.</li>
          <li><strong>Spot Healing Brush:</strong> I removed small marks and dust quickly while blending with surrounding pixels.</li>
          <li><strong>Healing Brush:</strong> I corrected larger blemishes with more control over texture and blending.</li>
          <li><strong>Adjustment Layers:</strong> I improved tone and contrast while keeping edits editable and reversible.</li>
          <li><strong>Zoom and careful selection:</strong> I worked in close detail to avoid altering facial features or important details.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Challenges and Improvements</h2>
        <p>
          The biggest challenge was balancing restoration with authenticity. If I removed
          too much texture, the photo could look plastic or unrealistic. I learned to
          make small, subtle edits and frequently compare my progress to the original.
          In the future, I would take additional time to refine tonal consistency across
          the entire image and create more “before/after” snapshots during the process.

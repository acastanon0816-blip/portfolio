        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
          This project is a magazine cover designed in Adobe Photoshop. The goal was to
          create a professional-looking cover with a strong visual hierarchy,
          readable typography, and a clear focal point. I designed the layout to feel
          realistic and visually appealing.

        <h2>Design Decisions</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Hierarchy:</strong> I made title and main headline stand out so the reader knows what the magazine content is at a glance.</li>
          <li><strong>Typography:</strong> I chose fonts and sizes that are readable and consistent across headlines and subheadings.</li>
          <li><strong>Composition:</strong> The text layout supports the cover image without obstructing important details.</li>
          <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> I used repeated spacing and alignment to create a clean, professional layout.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Tools and Techniques Used</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Layers and groups:</strong> organized text, images, and effects for easy editing.</li>
          <li><strong>Type tool:</strong> created the title, headlines, and cover lines.</li>
          <li><strong>Alignment and guides:</strong> kept spacing consistent to improve readability.</li>
          <li><strong>Selection tools and masks:</strong> refined the main image and adjusted it to select what appears on top or behind text.</li>
        
        </ul>

        <h2>Challenges and Improvements</h2>
        <p>
          The main challenge was balancing the action of the cover image with multiple elements of text. Too much can
          overcrowd the page, but too little looks unfinished. I learned to
          adjust spacing, size, and contrast, in consultation with the client, so that the cover lines stay readable while
          still supporting the main image and overall design.
